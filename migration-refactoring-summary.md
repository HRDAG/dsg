# DSG Migration Refactoring Summary

## Current Snapshot Chain Validation Analysis

### 1. Snapshot Chain Logic

The DSG migration system builds a hash chain across snapshots where:

- Each snapshot has:
  - `snapshot_previous`: Link to previous snapshot ID
  - `snapshot_hash`: Hash derived from current snapshot content and previous snapshot's hash

- The hash chain is computed as:
  ```
  For s1: hash(entries_hash + snapshot_message + "")
  For others: hash(entries_hash + snapshot_message + prev_snapshot_hash)
  ```

- This creates a tamper-evident chain where modifying any snapshot would invalidate all subsequent snapshot hashes.

### 2. Current Validation Status

The current implementation in `check_snapshot_chain()`:

- ✅ **Validates link integrity**: Ensures each snapshot's `snapshot_previous` field correctly points to its predecessor
- ✅ **Checks hash existence**: Verifies the `snapshot_hash` field exists in each snapshot
- ❌ **Missing hash verification**: Does not recompute and verify the hash values

As noted in the code:
```python
# Ideally, we'd recompute the hash here to validate it
# For now, just check that the hash exists
```

### 3. Security Implications

This represents a gap in the security model:
- The hash chain is built correctly during migration
- But validation doesn't fully leverage this chain to detect tampering
- If a previous snapshot's content was altered, the current validation would not detect it

## Proposed Enhancement

Implement complete hash chain validation that:

1. Recomputes each snapshot's hash using:
   - Its own entries_hash
   - Its snapshot_message
   - Previous snapshot's validated hash

2. Compares computed hash with stored hash

3. Reports any mismatches as validation failures

This enhancement would provide true tamper detection for the entire snapshot history.

## Next Steps

1. Modify `check_snapshot_chain()` to implement hash verification
2. Add debug logging for hash verification
3. Ensure proper handling of partial chain validation
4. Update tests to verify hash chain integrity
