# Migration Status & Snapshot Chain Fix

## Problem Identified

The migration was failing with "‚ùå FAIL - snapshot_chain: Broken links in 1 snapshots" when validating snapshots. 

After investigation, we found the issue was in the validation logic, not in the actual snapshot data:

1. When verifying a snapshot like S5, the validation would check it against its predecessor (S4). 
2. Since S4 was the first snapshot in the validation subset [S4, S5], the code erroneously expected S4 to have no previous link.
3. But S4 correctly had a previous link to S3, causing the validation to fail.

## Solution

We fixed the issue by adding an `is_partial_chain` parameter to the `check_snapshot_chain()` function:

1. When `is_partial_chain=True`, the function doesn't require the first snapshot in the subset to have no previous link.
2. We set this parameter to `True` for per-snapshot validation and `False` for full-chain validation.

## Code Changes

1. Added `is_partial_chain` parameter to `check_snapshot_chain()`
2. Modified the first snapshot validation logic:
   ```python
   elif not is_partial_chain:  # First snapshot check only if NOT a partial chain
       # Check first snapshot normally
   else:  # First snapshot in a partial chain
       # Don't flag having a previous link as an error
   ```

3. Updated call sites to specify whether they're validating a full or partial chain.

## Result

The validation now correctly handles both:
- Full-chain validation (requires first snapshot to have no previous link)
- Partial-chain validation (allows any snapshot to have appropriate previous links)

This improves the reliability of the migration process and avoids false validation failures.
