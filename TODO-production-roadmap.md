- `docs/troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions
- `examples/` - Sample repository configurations and workflows

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks

### 4. Security & Compliance Review ðŸ”’ **PRIORITY 4**

**Goal**: Ensure DSG meets HRDAG's security and data protection requirements

**Tasks**:
- **Security Audit**: Comprehensive review of ZFS transaction security
- **Access Control**: User permissions and repository access management
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit verification
- **Audit Logging**: Security-relevant event logging and retention
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Dependencies and code security scanning

**Files to create**:
- `docs/security.md` - Security architecture and procedures
- `scripts/security/` - Security scanning and validation tools
- `SECURITY.md` - Security reporting and procedures

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks

### 5. Performance Optimization & Scalability âš¡ **PRIORITY 5**

**Goal**: Optimize DSG for HRDAG's data scale and usage patterns

**Tasks**:
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Large-scale data sync performance testing
- **ZFS Tuning**: Optimize ZFS parameters for DSG workloads
- **Concurrency Optimization**: Multi-user performance under realistic loads
- **Storage Efficiency**: ZFS snapshot cleanup and space management
- **Network Optimization**: Transfer efficiency for large datasets

**Files to create**:
- `docs/performance.md` - Performance tuning guide
- `scripts/benchmarking/` - Performance testing and measurement tools
- `scripts/maintenance/` - Automated cleanup and optimization scripts

**Estimated Effort**: 2 weeks

### 6. Real-World Integration Testing ðŸ§ª **PRIORITY 6**

**Goal**: Validate DSG with actual HRDAG data and workflows

**Tasks**:
- **Pilot Project**: Select representative HRDAG project for DSG migration
- **Data Migration**: Safe migration of existing project to DSG
- **Workflow Validation**: Test actual researcher collaboration patterns
- **Performance Validation**: Verify performance with real data volumes
- **User Feedback**: Collect and incorporate researcher feedback

**Implementation Strategy**:
```python
# Pilot project selection criteria:
# - Medium complexity (not too simple, not too complex)
# - Active collaboration (multiple researchers)
# - Representative data types (typical HRDAG patterns)
# - Non-critical timeline (can handle migration issues)
```

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks

## Success Criteria

### Production Readiness Metrics
- **Production Deployment**: DSG running in production with real HRDAG data
- **User Adoption**: 3+ research teams actively using DSG
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with comprehensive monitoring
- **Performance**: Sync operations complete within acceptable time bounds
- **Security**: Security audit passed with no critical findings
- **Documentation**: Complete user guides and operational procedures

### User Experience Metrics
- **Onboarding Time**: New users productive within 1 day
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages with actionable solutions
- **Workflow Efficiency**: DSG enhances rather than hinders research workflows
- **Collaboration**: Multi-user workflows smooth and conflict-free

### Operational Metrics
- **Monitoring Coverage**: All critical operations monitored and alerted
- **Recovery Time**: Mean time to recovery < 30 minutes for common issues
- **Maintenance**: Automated maintenance procedures working correctly
- **Backup**: Regular backups with tested recovery procedures

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase Sequencing
1. **Production Environment Planning** (2-3 weeks) - Foundation
2. **Operational Excellence & Monitoring** (2-3 weeks) - Reliability
3. **User Experience & Documentation** (1-2 weeks) - Usability
4. **Security & Compliance Review** (1-2 weeks) - Compliance  
5. **Performance Optimization** (2 weeks) - Scalability
6. **Real-World Integration Testing** (3-4 weeks) - Validation

### Dependencies
- **Production Environment** prerequisite for all other phases
- **Monitoring** should be established before **Real-World Testing**
- **Documentation** should be complete before **User Training**
- **Security Review** should precede **Production Data Migration**

### Total Estimated Timeline
**11-16 weeks** for complete production readiness, depending on parallelization and HRDAG-specific requirements.

## Risk Assessment & Mitigations

### Production Deployment Risks
- **Production Scale**: *Mitigation* - Performance benchmarking and ZFS tuning
- **User Adoption**: *Mitigation* - Excellent documentation and training
- **Data Migration**: *Mitigation* - Careful pilot project selection and gradual rollout
- **Operational Complexity**: *Mitigation* - Comprehensive monitoring and automation

### Technical Advantages
- **Reliable Foundation**: No packaging issues, stable configuration system
- **Proven Technology**: ZFS transaction system thoroughly tested
- **Type Safety**: Configuration validation prevents many errors
- **Scalability**: Explicit config works at any scale
- **Maintainability**: Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns

## Production Architecture Requirements

1. **Reliability**: All operations must be atomic and recoverable
2. **Performance**: ZFS efficiency maintained at production scale
3. **Security**: Data protection throughout sync lifecycle
4. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging
5. **Maintainability**: Clear operational procedures and automation
6. **Explicitness**: Repository configuration is explicit and type-safe

## Current Configuration Support

DSG supports both repository format (recommended) and legacy format:

### Repository Format (Recommended)
```yaml
name: my-project
repository:
  type: zfs
  host: localhost
  pool: dsgtest
  mountpoint: /var/tmp/test
```

### Legacy Format (Still Supported)
```yaml
name: my-project
transport: ssh
ssh:
  host: localhost
  path: /var/tmp/test
  type: zfs
```

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Priority 1**: Production Environment Planning
2. **Establish monitoring early**: Priority 2 should begin as soon as production environment is defined
3. **Parallel documentation**: Priority 3 can proceed in parallel with operational setup
4. **Security review**: Should be completed before handling real HRDAG data
5. **Performance optimization**: Essential before large-scale deployment
6. **Pilot testing**: Final validation with real research workflows

DSG is ready for production deployment. The roadmap above provides a clear path with estimated timelines and success criteria.
