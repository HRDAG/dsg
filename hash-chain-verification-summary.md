# Hash Chain Verification Implementation

## Implementation Summary

We've enhanced the snapshot chain validation by adding full hash chain verification:

1. **Hash Chain Logic**: Each snapshot's hash is based on:
   - Its own `entries_hash` (hash of all entries in the manifest)
   - Its `snapshot_message` (from user or push log)
   - Its predecessor's `snapshot_hash` (or empty string for first snapshot)

2. **Hash Calculation**: Using xxhash.xxh3_64():
   ```python
   h = xxhash.xxh3_64()
   h.update(entries_hash.encode())
   h.update(message.encode())
   h.update(prev_hash.encode())  # or b"" for first snapshot
   computed_hash = h.hexdigest()
   ```

3. **Verification Process**:
   - For the first snapshot in a full chain:
     - Verify hash using empty string as previous hash
   - For subsequent snapshots:
     - Verify hash using previously verified snapshot's hash
   - For partial chains:
     - Verify hashes within the chain segment
     - Skip hash verification for the first snapshot (can't verify without predecessor)

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Reports missing hash fields
   - Detects hash mismatches
   - Handles computation errors

## Security Benefits

This implementation provides true tamper evidence:

1. **Complete Chain Integrity**: Each snapshot's hash depends on all previous snapshots
2. **Change Detection**: Any alteration to a snapshot breaks all subsequent hashes
3. **Strong Cryptographic Evidence**: Relies on xxhash for efficient, secure hashing

## Debugging Support

We've added detailed debug logging to aid in troubleshooting:

1. **Hash Inputs**: Logs all hash calculation inputs
2. **Verification Results**: Records success/failure of each hash verification
3. **Error Details**: Provides specific error information for failed verifications

## Testing Results

The implementation was successfully tested on repository LK with no hash verification failures. The migration process correctly:
- Generates hashes during snapshot creation
- Passes them to subsequent snapshots
- Verifies the full hash chain during validation

## Future Enhancements

Possible future improvements:
- Expose hash verification metrics in reports
- Add tamper recovery options
- Implement hash verification in user-facing inspection tools
