# DSG Post-Phase 2 Production Roadmap

**Status**: Phase 2 Complete - Production Planning Required  
**Version**: 0.4.0  
**Date**: 2025-06-17  
**Context**: Phase 2 ZFS transaction system fully implemented with 99.8% test success rate

## Executive Summary

**Current State**: DSG Phase 2 is complete with comprehensive ZFS transaction system, achieving atomic operations for all sync scenarios. The system demonstrates production-level functionality with extensive test coverage (895 tests, 99.8% success rate).

**Next Focus**: Real-world deployment, production hardening, and operational excellence. Phase 2 delivered the technical foundation; now we need production readiness.

## Phase 2 Completion Summary

### âœ… Fully Implemented
- **ZFS Transaction System**: Auto-detecting init vs sync patterns with atomic operations
- **Multi-User Collaboration**: Comprehensive conflict detection and resolution workflows  
- **End-to-End Workflows**: Complete sync lifecycle validation with real ZFS integration
- **Test Infrastructure**: 895 comprehensive tests covering all 15 sync states
- **Transaction Patterns**: Clean init (rename) and robust sync (cloneâ†’promote) operations
- **Real ZFS Integration**: All operations tested with actual ZFS datasets (dsgtest pool)

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Achievements
- **Atomicity**: All operations either fully succeed or fully roll back
- **Conflict Detection**: Proper identification and blocking of problematic sync states

### **3.5 Performance Optimization & Scalability**

**Goal**: Optimize DSG for HRDAG's data scale and usage patterns

**Current Gap**: Performance testing done with test data; need real-world optimization

**Tasks**:
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Large-scale data sync performance testing
- **ZFS Tuning**: Optimize ZFS parameters for DSG workloads
- **Concurrency Optimization**: Multi-user performance under realistic loads
- **Storage Efficiency**: ZFS snapshot cleanup and space management
- **Network Optimization**: Transfer efficiency for large datasets

**Files to create**:
- `docs/performance.md` - Performance tuning guide
- `scripts/benchmarking/` - Performance testing and measurement tools
- `scripts/maintenance/` - Automated cleanup and optimization scripts

### **3.6 Real-World Integration Testing**

**Goal**: Validate DSG with actual HRDAG data and workflows

**Current Gap**: All testing done with synthetic data; need real-world validation

**Tasks**:
- **Pilot Project**: Select representative HRDAG project for DSG migration
- **Data Migration**: Safe migration of existing project to DSG
- **Workflow Validation**: Test actual researcher collaboration patterns
- **Performance Validation**: Verify performance with real data volumes
- **User Feedback**: Collect and incorporate researcher feedback

**Implementation Strategy**:
```python
# Pilot project selection criteria:
# - Medium complexity (not too simple, not too complex)
# - Active collaboration (multiple researchers)
# - Representative data types (typical HRDAG patterns)
# - Non-critical timeline (can handle migration issues)
```
