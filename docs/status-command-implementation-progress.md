# DSG Status Command - Implementation Progress

**Date:** 2025-06-02  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Priority:** High - Core functionality

## Overview

The `dsg status` command shows sync status by comparing local files with last sync, similar to `git status`. This document tracks implementation progress and remaining work.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### 1. Critical Bug Fixes

#### Hash Comparison Issue (RESOLVED)
- **Problem:** Status showed 223 files as "modified locally" in freshly cloned repository due to hash comparison failures
- **Root Cause:** `FileRef.__eq__()` required both objects to have hash values, but local scans often don't have hashes computed yet while cache does
- **Solution:** Modified `FileRef.__eq__()` and `LinkRef.__eq__()` to fall back to metadata comparison (`eq_shallow()`) when hash values are missing
- **Files Changed:** 
  - `src/dsg/manifest.py`: Updated equality methods
  - `tests/test_manifest_coverage.py`: Updated tests for new behavior
  - `tests/test_manifest_merger.py`: Added verification test

#### Symlink Dereferencing Bug (RESOLVED)
- **Problem:** Clone operation was converting symlinks to regular files, causing false "modified" status
- **Root Cause:** `shutil.copy2()` was following symlinks by default
- **Solution:** Added `follow_symlinks=False` parameter to preserve symlinks during clone
- **Files Changed:**
  - `src/dsg/backends.py`: Fixed LocalFilesystem backend clone method
  - `tests/test_backends.py`: Added test to verify symlink preservation

### 2. Status Command Implementation
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Basic functionality working
- **Location:** `src/dsg/cli.py:488-528` and `src/dsg/operations.py:123-206`
- **Features:** 
  - Shows added, modified, deleted files
  - Supports `--remote` flag for team change visibility
  - Integrates with ManifestMerger for sync state classification
  - Verbose debugging mode available

## üîÑ Remaining Work

### 1. Path Normalization Detection (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Issue:** Status command should flag files with non-normalized paths (NFD vs NFC Unicode)
- **Current State:** Path normalization exists in `filename_validation.py` but not integrated with status
- **Required Changes:**
  - Integrate `validate_path()` checks into status scanning
  - Display warning/error messages for non-normalized paths
  - Provide guidance on running normalization before sync
  - Consider auto-normalization workflow

### 2. Code Cleanup - Remove eq_shallow (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Issue:** With new fallback behavior in `__eq__()`, `eq_shallow()` methods may be redundant
- **Required Changes:**
  - Audit all uses of `eq_shallow()` across codebase
  - Replace with `==` where appropriate
  - Remove `eq_shallow()` methods if no longer needed
  - Update tests accordingly
- **Files to Review:**
  - `src/dsg/manifest.py`: FileRef.eq_shallow(), LinkRef.eq_shallow()
  - `src/dsg/manifest.py`: recover_or_compute_metadata() usage
  - Any other callers found during audit

### 3. Enhanced Status Features (LOWER PRIORITY)
- **File conflict detection:** Identify files that would conflict during sync
- **Size change reporting:** Show files with significant size changes
- **Timestamp analysis:** Detect files with suspicious timestamp changes
- **Performance optimization:** Cache hash computations for large repositories

## Technical Notes

### ManifestMerger Integration
- Status command uses `ManifestMerger` to classify files into 15 different sync states
- Three-way comparison: local (current scan) vs cache (.dsg/last-sync.json) vs remote
- Successful integration demonstrates proper architecture separation

### Hash Computation Strategy
- Local files: Hash computed during `recover_or_compute_metadata()` 
- Cache files: Hash read from `.dsg/last-sync.json`
- Remote files: Hash read from remote manifest
- New equality logic handles missing hashes gracefully

### Symlink Handling
- LocalFilesystem backend: Now preserves symlinks with `follow_symlinks=False`
- SSH backend: Already preserved symlinks via `rsync -a` archive mode
- Consistent behavior across all backend types

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- ‚úÖ Hash comparison fallback behavior
- ‚úÖ Symlink preservation during clone
- ‚úÖ ManifestMerger integration
- ‚úÖ Basic status command functionality
- ‚ùå Path normalization detection (TODO)
- ‚ùå eq_shallow removal verification (TODO)

### Integration Testing
- Status command tested with real repository (test-SV)
- Result: "Everything up to date" ‚úÖ (was showing 223 false positives)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Implement path normalization detection in status command
2. **Short-term:** Audit and remove redundant `eq_shallow()` methods  
3. **Medium-term:** Add enhanced status features as needed
4. **Long-term:** Performance optimization for large repositories
