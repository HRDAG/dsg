# Phase 2 Migration Status

**Author**: PB & Claude  
**Date**: 2025-05-29  
**Last Updated**: 2025-05-29  
**Status**: Production-ready with parallel batch processing support

## Overview

Phase 2 migration (BTRFS to ZFS) is now complete with comprehensive testing and validation infrastructure. The migration successfully transfers normalized data from Phase 1 to ZFS with proper metadata preservation and validation.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Eliminated Redundant Normalization
- **Problem**: Phase 2 was creating temporary normalized copies even though Phase 1 already normalized the data
- **Solution**: Removed `normalize_source()` calls and temp directory creation
- **Impact**: Faster migration, less disk usage, cleaner process flow
- **Files modified**: `scripts/migration/migrate.py`

### 2. Created ZFS-Aware Validation Infrastructure
- **Problem**: Validation was designed for directory-based manifests, not ZFS snapshots + DSG metadata
- **Solution**: Updated validation to understand ZFS structure and DSG metadata format
- **Key changes**:
  - Checks ZFS snapshots exist instead of directories
  - Validates `.dsg/last-sync.json` and `sync-messages.json` format
  - Only validates actually migrated snapshots (respects `--limit`)
  - Excludes metadata files (`.snap`, `.zfs`, `HEAD`, `lost+found`, `.Trash-*`) from content comparison
- **Files created**: 
  - `tests/migration/migration_validation.py` - Reusable validation functions
  - `tests/migration/test_phase2_integration.py` - Integration tests
  - `scripts/migration/validate_migration.py` - Production validation CLI

### 3. Production-Ready Migration Scripts
- **Shell Script**: `scripts/migration/run_migration_with_validation.sh`
  - Single repository migration with validation
  - Handles ZFS dataset cleanup automatically
  - Integrated logging and validation
  - Works for both partial (`--limit=N`) and full migrations

- **Batch Script**: `scripts/batch_migrate.py` (NEW)
  - Parallel multi-repository migration
  - Atomic locking mechanism for worker coordination
  - Automatic load balancing across workers
  - Integrated validation and progress tracking
  
- **Usage**: 
  ```bash
  # Single repository migration
  scripts/migration/run_migration_with_validation.sh SV 5
  
  # Batch migration with multiple workers
  uv run python scripts/batch_migrate.py migrate-all --verbose
  
  # Check migration status
  uv run python scripts/batch_migrate.py status
  
  # Clean up stale locks
  uv run python scripts/batch_migrate.py cleanup-locks
  ```

## Technical Details

### Migration Process Flow
1. **Phase 1**: Creates normalized copy at `/var/repos/btrsnap/{REPO}-norm`
2. **Phase 2**: 
   - Destroys/recreates ZFS dataset `zsd/{REPO}`
   - For each snapshot:
     - Rsyncs directly from normalized source (no temp dirs)
     - Excludes metadata directories (`.snap`, `.zfs`, etc.)
     - Generates manifest from ZFS filesystem
     - Creates ZFS snapshot
     - Stores metadata in `.dsg/` directory
   - Creates consolidated metadata files
   - Supports parallel processing with atomic locking

### ZFS + DSG Structure
```
/var/repos/zsd/SV/
├── .dsg/
│   ├── last-sync.json      # Current manifest + metadata
│   ├── sync-messages.json  # All snapshot metadata
│   └── archive/            # Previous manifests
├── clean/                  # Actual data directories
├── individual/
└── match/

ZFS snapshots: zsd/SV@s1, zsd/SV@s2, ..., zsd/SV@s5
```

### Validation Framework
The validation system works for both test and production:

1. **file_transfer**: Verifies ZFS snapshots exist and current state matches last source snapshot
2. **manifests_exist**: Checks `.dsg/` structure and file formats
3. **push_log_data**: Validates push log metadata integration
4. **file_contents**: Hash comparison with sampling for large repos

### Key Format Understanding
- **sync-messages.json**: Dictionary with `snapshots` field containing metadata for each snapshot
- **last-sync.json**: Standard DSG manifest with current state
- **ZFS snapshots**: Store historical states as `zsd/REPO@sN`

## Testing Results

### Integration Test
✅ **test_phase2_integration.py** passes - validates core migration flow

### Production Validation  
✅ **Multiple repository tests**:
- Successfully migrated repositories with batch processing
- All validation checks passing (file_transfer, manifests_exist, push_log_data, file_contents)
- Parallel worker coordination functioning correctly
- No data loss or corruption detected

## Usage Guide

### For Development/Testing
```bash
# Run integration tests
uv run pytest tests/migration/test_phase2_integration.py -v

# Test migration with validation
scripts/migration/run_migration_with_validation.sh REPO 5
```

### For Production

#### Single Repository
```bash
# Migrate specific number of snapshots
scripts/migration/run_migration_with_validation.sh REPO 10

# Migrate all snapshots  
scripts/migration/run_migration_with_validation.sh REPO

# Validate existing migration
uv run python scripts/migration/validate_migration.py REPO
```

#### Batch Migration (Recommended)
```bash
# Run batch migration with multiple workers
# Terminal 1
uv run python scripts/batch_migrate.py migrate-all --verbose

# Terminal 2 (concurrent)
uv run python scripts/batch_migrate.py migrate-all --verbose

# Check status
uv run python scripts/batch_migrate.py status

# Clean up locks if needed
uv run python scripts/batch_migrate.py cleanup-locks
```

### Logs and Debugging
- **Migration logs**: `/home/pball/tmp/log/migration-{REPO}-{timestamp}.log`
- **Console output**: INFO level (not DEBUG) for readable progress
- **File logging**: DEBUG level for troubleshooting

## Validation Details

### What Gets Validated
1. **ZFS Snapshots**: All source snapshots have corresponding ZFS snapshots
2. **File Transfer**: Current ZFS state matches last migrated source snapshot  
3. **Metadata Structure**: Proper `.dsg/` directory with required files
4. **Push Log Integration**: Source push log data preserved in sync messages
5. **File Integrity**: Hash verification of sample files (configurable sampling)

### What Gets Excluded
- Metadata directories (`.snap/`, `.zfs/`, `.dsg/`)
- System files (`HEAD`, `lost+found`, `.Trash-*`)
- Hidden files (except where explicitly needed)
- Snapshots not migrated (when using `--limit`)
- DSG internal files during content comparison

## Files Modified/Created

### Core Migration
- **Modified**: `scripts/migration/migrate.py` - Removed redundant normalization, fixed permission issues
- **Modified**: `scripts/migration/snapshot_info.py` - Added sudo support for restricted files
- **Created**: `scripts/migration/run_migration_with_validation.sh` - Single repo migration
- **Created**: `scripts/batch_migrate.py` - Parallel batch migration with locking

### Validation Infrastructure  
- **Created**: `tests/migration/migration_validation.py` - Reusable validation functions
- **Created**: `tests/migration/test_phase2_integration.py` - Integration tests
- **Created**: `scripts/migration/validate_migration.py` - Production validation CLI

### Documentation
- **Updated**: `scripts/migration/README.md` - Added Phase 2 testing status
- **Created**: `docs/phase2-migration-status.md` - This document

## Known Issues Resolved

### Permission Issues (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Push log files in `.snap/` directories required elevated permissions
- **Solution**: All file access now uses `sudo test -f` and `sudo cat` commands
- **Impact**: Migration can now handle all repositories regardless of permission restrictions

### Parallel Processing (IMPLEMENTED)
- **Problem**: Single repository processing was slow for many repositories
- **Solution**: Created batch migration script with atomic locking in `/tmp/dsg-migration-locks/`
- **Impact**: Multiple workers can now process repositories in parallel without conflicts

### Consistency Issues (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Different components excluded different files causing validation failures
- **Solution**: Unified exclusion patterns across rsync, validation, and manifest generation
- **Impact**: All components now consistently handle metadata and system files

## Future Considerations

1. **Progress Reporting**: Could add progress bars for large migrations
2. **Rollback**: Could add ZFS snapshot rollback capabilities
3. **Performance Optimization**: Could parallelize file validation within single repository
4. **Monitoring**: Could add real-time dashboard for batch migration progress
