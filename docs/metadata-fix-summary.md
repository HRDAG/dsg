# Metadata Timestamp Fix Summary

This summary documents the changes made to correctly use timestamps from push.log files in snapshot metadata instead of the current time.

## Problem

During migration, the `created_at` field in snapshot metadata was being set to the current time of migration instead of using the original timestamp from the push log file. This resulted in inconsistent timestamps that did not reflect the actual creation time of the snapshots.

## Solution

The solution involves modifying the metadata creation process to use the timestamp from .snap/push.log files:

1. Enhanced the `ManifestMetadata._create` method to accept an optional timestamp parameter:
   - Updated `manifest.py` to pass the timestamp to `_dt()` function

2. Updated the `Manifest.generate_metadata` method to accept a timestamp parameter:
   - Made sure the timestamp is used when creating metadata

3. Modified the `Manifest.to_json` method to accept a timestamp parameter:
   - Ensured timestamp is passed to metadata creation when needed

4. Modified snapshot_info.py to convert timestamps to LA timezone:
   - Improved timestamp parsing in `parse_push_log` function
   - Updated `create_default_snapshot_info` to use LA timezone

5. Enhanced migrate.py to extract actual timestamps:
   - Now parses and uses the timestamp from the push.log line
   - Improved the error handling and fallback logic

6. Updated manifest_utils.py to pass timestamps to the appropriate functions:
   - Modified `write_dsg_metadata` to pass the timestamp to `to_json`
   - Ensured consistency with sync-messages.json and last-sync.json

## Benefits

1. **Historical Accuracy**: Metadata now correctly reflects the original creation time of each snapshot
2. **Consistent Timestamps**: All timestamps in last-sync.json and sync-messages.json use the same format and timezone (LA timezone)
3. **Improved Data Lineage**: The preserved timestamps ensure an accurate historical record of when snapshots were created

## Implementation Details

1. **Timestamp Source**: The timestamp is read from the .snap/push.log file which has the format:
   ```
   REPO/sXX | USER | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC (Day) | MESSAGE
   ```

2. **Timezone Handling**:
   - Timestamps are parsed from UTC format in the log
   - Converted to LA timezone (America/Los_Angeles) to ensure consistency with `_dt()` function
   - Using the same timezone format throughout the application

3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - If a timestamp cannot be parsed, the system falls back to the current time
   - Includes detailed logging of any timestamp parsing failures

The implementation ensures that all metadata timestamps accurately reflect the original creation time of snapshots while maintaining format consistency throughout the application.
